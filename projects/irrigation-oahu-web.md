## About
My friend has local business "Quality Irrigation Oahu", which focuses on irrigation systems and plumbing. We decided that it would be beneficial for the business to have a website, so I've been working on it.

## Implementation
I chose Django for back end, because it has lots of great features built in, such as: one of the best out-of-the-box security system; it comes with pythong unit test framework, which makes debuging waaayy easier; MVC core architecture; has built-in admin page, which makes interaction with database very easy for administrators. I am thinking of using Node.js for front end, since it works very well with Django and I just started learning JavaScript (perfect timing). I am going to use PostgreSQL for the database. It is a solid database and Django has lots of cool features that are specifically made for it.

## What I have learnt so far
I learnt how to set up a database and connect it to back end side of a website. I strengthened my knowledge of Django framework.

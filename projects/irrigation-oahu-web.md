## About
My friend has a local business "Quality Irrigation Oahu", which focuses on irrigation systems and plumbing. We decided that it would be beneficial for the business to have a website, so I've been working on it.

## Implementation
I chose Django for the back end because it has lots of great features built in, such as one of the best out-of-the-box security systems; it comes with Python unit test framework, which makes debugging way easier; MVC core architecture; has built-in admin page, which makes interaction with database very easy for administrators. I am thinking of using Node.js for the front end since it works very well with Django and I just started learning JavaScript (perfect timing). I am going to use PostgreSQL for the database. It is a solid database and Django has lots of cool features that are specifically made for it.

## What I have learnt so far
I learnt how to set up a database and connect it to the back end side of a website. I strengthened my knowledge of the Django framework. Learnt more about tools used for web design.

## Milestones
CableTrack PRO development was managed via issue-driven approach using milestones as projects.

#### M1
In Milestone 1, we concentrated on laying out foundational functionality, primarly the components that will be used to create the pages. My primary task was to create Mockups in Figma, Logo in Adobe Illustrator and populate the organization's webpage with the designs. 

#### M2
In Milestone 2, we were putting together the pages utilizing the components created during M1. My main task was to implement the mockups into actual web pages, create user page and update the organization's website with the actual screenshots from the website.

#### M3
In Milestone 3, we were writing tests and documentation. I wrote tests for sign-in and sign-up pages and updated the organization's page with the latest updates.

## What I learnt from this course?
First of all, I wanted to start learning JavaScript but never really had a strong reason for it, so I am glad that I took this class. JavaScript really seemed like a very powerful language especially for web development. Both backend and frontend can be written in one language which is a huge advantage. I really enjoyed that the class is not solely theory focused but a balance of theory and practice. Finally, I got comfortable working with version contro system, such GIT, which I think is going to make my future project much more manageble and structured.

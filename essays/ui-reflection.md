	If you have a strong why- you have all the reasons to make it happen. Why use UI frameworks, such as Bootstrap? Well, the idea of frameworks flows directly from their names- they provide frames. Why do we want frames and not start from scratch? Having a frame makes our work much easier, all we need to do is to just start adding to it. Why do we want to simplify our work? Because, our most precious resource, time, is limited and we want to try to accomplish as much as we possibly can in it.

	During the 7th week of the class, we were introduced to the UI framework, Bootstrap. I honestly found working with that frustrating. It seemed to me like learning a completely new language. I couldn’t fully make use of the benefits that the framework was supposed to provide, due to my limited knowledge of its foundation, CSS. I strongly believe if we spent more time on CSS then Bootstrap would make much more sense and my experience with it would be less overwhelming.

	In conclusion, I just want to add that everything requires time and effort to achieve certain levels of proficiency in it, I understand that the course, ICS314, is not meant to go in depth with aspects of software engineering but just scratching the surface and it takes time and effort to achieve certain levels of proficiency in any subject, so we shouldn’t be too stressed even if we didn’t reach our expectations.
